# Peer Review Comments: The CYOA Trick or Treat was a treat to play! :) I would have liked to see a little more consistency in the styling of all the various pages. For example, some pages had images or full background images while others did not. Additionally, the Middle Class pages did not have a custom "Title" in the html. Lastly, on the "You Accepted The Candy" page, the font of the text does not match the rest. Overall, great job.
