    <h1 class="bloodRed storyTxt">THE RUN DOWN NEIGHBORHOOD</h1>
    <p class="storyTxt white storyMargin arial">You decide that you want to take your chances with the run down neighborhood. You start to approach the first house, and you can just tell that you are in a run down neighborhood. The house looks like it's been hit by a tornado at least twice. There's windows with broken glass, the roof looks like it's going to fall off, their little tree in the front looks like it could fall on anyone at any second, etc... But even though the house looks messed up, you approach the front door, ring the non existent doorbell button, and an old lady with 5 at least missing teeth opens the door. You say "trick or treat!", and the old lady gives you a smile that makes chills go down your spine, but she holds a bucket full of candy that seems delicious, DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A CANDY? </p>
