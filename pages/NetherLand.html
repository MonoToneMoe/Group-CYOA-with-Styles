    <p class="storyTxt arial storyMargin white">You politely decline the candy. You knew something was up, and you didn't want to take a chance.
    Unofrtunately, it was pretty clear that you were doomed the moment you knocked on her front door, as you get hit with something on the back,
    causing you to feel a little wobbly. Your view becomes blurry as you decide that, on the cold, hard pavement, that now was a great time to take a nap.
    You finally wake up, everything feels strange and you ask for help, but it appears you're truly doomed, for you have arrived... in the Netherlands.</p>
